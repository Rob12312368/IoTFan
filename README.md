# IoTFan
I use LM35 to detect the indoor temperature. If it is above 31 celsius degree, the fan turns on, and it shuts down when the temperature is below 31. The temperature is shown on a LCD.

# Goals
The fan turns on and off automatically based on a temperature threshold and can be cotrolled remotely.

# Tools
+ C++ (for writing code on ESP8266)
